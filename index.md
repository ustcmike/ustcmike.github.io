Welcome to Hang's homepage! 

__Hang WANG will join [Arizona State University](https://engineering.asu.edu) as a Ph.D. student this summer! Hang's challenging journey in ASU will be mentored by [Prof. Junshan Zhang](http://informationnet.asu.edu)!__

Hang(航) WONG(or WANG, 王) received his B.E. from Automation, School of Information Science and Technology, [University of Science and Technology of China, P. R. China](http://www.ustc.edu.cn/)(USTC). He has been the member of The Talent Program in Information Science and Technology since 2014. He was fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Ao Li](http://bioinformatics.ustc.edu.cn/teams.html) in USTC.

Hang's current research involves investigating how to use the principle of control theory, information theory and game theory to serve the physical world. Hang's research interests lie primarily in the area of the information networks, including the smart-grid, biomedical information and social media. 

Hang is also an amateur violinist (Level 8) since 8 years old.
