Welcome to my homepage! 

My name is Hang(航) WONG(or WANG, 王), a final-year bachelor student in the Department of Automation, School of Information Science and Technology, [University of Science and Technology of China, P. R. China](http://www.ustc.edu.cn/). I'm the member of The Talent Program in Information Science and Technology, USTC. I'm also the member of the [Health Informatics Lab](http://bioinformatics.ustc.edu.cn/) and my advisor is [Prof. Ao Li](http://bioinformatics.ustc.edu.cn/teams.html).

My research interests include data mining and its wide application on biomedical information, social media, financial analysis and related fields. Also I'm thrilled about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
